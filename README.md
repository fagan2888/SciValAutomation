# SciValAutomation
Beginning of automated method to process raw data files exported from Scival into flat file, either use to visualize in matplotlib or PowerBI. 

End goal of this project is to move away from flat files as much as possible--future updates will likely include export of data to MongoDB or an SQL db.
